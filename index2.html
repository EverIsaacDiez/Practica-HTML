            Today much of the research on bipolarity and schizophrenia no longer focuses
            on neurons, but on the glia. What's that?
        </p>
        <p>
            The "glia", "glial cells" or simply "glia" are cells found in our nervous tissue. Not
            only in our brain: they are also in the peripheral nerves that run through our body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout history, all the cells in our brain that were not classifiable as neurons 
            (that is, lacking the ability to send electrical impulses, which 
            <strong id="important-part-of-p">
                are not electrically excitable) 
            </strong>
            were classified as glia.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are not a few cells that fall within that label. If we consider that there are
            about a hundred trillion neurons in our brain, there are ten times as many glial
            cells. Almost nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, we know that its percentage, the 
            <strong>
                amount of glia per neuron, 
            </strong>
                increases exponentially according to the complexity of the organism. This indicates that it is
            a very important element.
        </p>
        <p>
            Classifying all those cells as glia, just like that, turned this word into a generic and 
            vague term.
        </p>
        <p>
            It encompassed too many types of very different groups of cells, and of very 
            diverse origins. This was not due to the laziness of researchers when looking for 
            words, but to the historical complexity involved in 
            <strong>
                discovering and studying glia .
            </strong>    
        </p>
        <p> 
            Over time new classifications became necessary. Some were based on their size: 
            the macroglia - such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes - and the microglia. Also 
            in its location: central nervous system or peripheral nervous system.

            The "aristocracy" need help
        </h2>
        <p>
            We have already seen what glias are and that they are not few.
        </p>
        <p>
            But 
            <strong>
                why has
            </strong> 
            your research 
            <strong>
                become important ? 
            </strong>    
            Are not neurons the privileged 
            cells of the brain, the smartest of the class, the most important and beautiful, the 
            "butterflies of the soul" as defined by the great Ramón y Cajal?

            Well, yes, we cannot deny that 
            <strong>
                neurons will always be the electrical aristocracy 
            </strong>
            of brain cells, but neither that they need more help in their day-to-day life than 
            previously thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Formerly it was assumed that the main role of the glia was the simple attachment 
            of the neuron, that of uniting and creating the internal structure of the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the brain were a Christmas tree, 
            <strong>
                the glia would be the tree and the branches, 
            </strong>
            and the neurons would be the decorations. Not surprisingly, the word glía comes 
            from the Greek λοία, which translates as "union or glue". Neuroglia would come to 
            mean the "glue of neurons".
        </p>
        <p>
            Today it is becoming increasingly clear that the function of microglia is not only to 
            support neurons and to be the brain glue. They are "helper" cells that can 
            significantly influence the normal maturation and functioning of neurons.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this sense, we can simplify their relationship in an example in which we see the 
            precious neuron as a little princess and the glía as her cohort of servants who 
            always accompany her and who are in charge of taking care of her, feeding her 
            and protecting her.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have to do great work for the welfare and 
            <strong>
                facilitate the schedule of obligations 
            </strong>
            of his wife (and little recognized until now).
        </p>
        <p>
            Today we know that each of these maidservants have very specialized functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can see the microglia both as "guardians" who ensure the safety of their wives, 
            as "cleaners" of remains (since they are specialized macrophages of the brain that, 
            among other tasks, will detect infections and take immune measures).
        </p>

            We can see astrocytes with various functions, such as "cooks" who are in charge of 
            feeding neurons. They are also "secretaries" that help the neuron to send its signals.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Whose "fault" is it when the system fails?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The question that arises is somewhat obvious: when there is not quite adequate functioning 
            in neural function, is it really the neuron that fails or is it that its helpers do not do 
            their job correctly? Or do both fail?
        </p>
        <p>
            The vast majority of research tends to point out that the glia plays its role in the 
            activity of neurons in 
            <strong>
                bipolarity and in schizophrenia .
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The exact answer is more difficult than it sounds. We have already talked about 
            the large number of glia, their subtypes, their location, and their different functions. 
            Not only that, we also have to see other related aspects, such as the 
            age and development of the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            All this makes it very complex to obtain resounding answers with so many conditioning factors. 
            Several studies have found decreases in the number and quantity of glial cells in people who have 
            suffered severe affective episodes (mainly in the prefrontal cortex).
        </p>
        <p>
            Nor can it be ruled out that the activation of glial cells greatly influences the synthesis of 
            neurotransmitters as important as serotonin and neuronal plasticity itself 
            (which would be the brain's ability to modify its structure and function).
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there is still a long way to go before we can reach firm conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even so, it seems more than evident that knowledge of the glia will help enormously 
            to discover and establish new relationships between brain and behavior, and that it may 
            open the doors to new research and forms of treatment of psychotic and affective conditions.
